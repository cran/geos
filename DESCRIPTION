Description: Provides an R API to the Open Source Geometry Engine
  ('GEOS') library (<https://libgeos.org/>) and a vector format 
  with which to efficiently store 'GEOS' geometries. High-performance functions 
  to extract information from, calculate relationships between, and
  transform geometries are provided. Finally, facilities to import 
  and export geometry vectors to other spatial formats are provided.
